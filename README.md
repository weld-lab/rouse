# rouse
Solving Langevin dynamics for the Rouse model, in Common Lisp.

## Goal

The goal is to write an engine for solving Langevin dynamics for the Rouse model, including

* an **easy setup** of simulation parameters (temperature, friction, chain length, etc)
* an **interactive 3d viewer** to visualize the polymer motion in real time
* a **time navigation system**, allowing the user to move **forward or backward in time**, fork alternative trajectories, and explore different dynamical branches from any saved state
* a **simple export interface** to save trajectories or snapshots once a satisfying state or regime has been reached, for later analysis or visualization
